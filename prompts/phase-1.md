**Role:** Act as a World-Class Product Manager and Lead Systems Architect with experience in winning hackathons and building award-winning consumer apps.
**Context:** We are a hackathon team called **"Ctrl+Alt+Delight"**. We are building a web application called **"CocktAIl"**.
**Goal:** Create a "Winning Software Requirements Specification (SRS)" that will win the requirements competition. The requirements must be technically feasible for a hackathon timeframe but visionary enough to wow the judges.
**The App Concept:** "CocktAIl" is an AI-powered cocktail assistant.
*   *Core Value:* It doesn't just list recipes; it creates them based on what the user has, how they feel, or the theme of their party.
*   *Vibe:* Fun, premium, interactive, and "delightful" (playing on our team name).
**Your Task:** Generate a comprehensive Requirements Document in Markdown format. It must include the following sections:
1.  **Executive Summary & Elevator Pitch**: A punchy, hook-filled intro.
2.  **Target Audience & Personas**: Define 2 distinct personas (e.g., "The Panic Host" and "The Mixology Nerd").
3.  **Core Features (The "Delight" Stack)**:
    *   *Must-Haves (MVP):* The critical path.
    *   *Should-Haves:* High-value features.
    *   *The "Ctrl+Alt+Delight" Feature:* One unique, "wow" feature that uses AI in a novel way (e.g., "Snap & Sip" - take a photo of ingredients to get a recipe).
4.  **Functional Requirements**: Detailed user stories (As a... I want to... So that...).
5.  **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, UI/UX standards (e.g., "Glassmorphism UI", "Mobile-First").
6.  **Technical Stack Recommendation**: Suggest a modern, fast stack (e.g., React/Vite, Tailwind, Gemini API).
7.  **Success Metrics**: How do we measure "Delight"?
**Tone:** Professional but energetic. Use formatting (bolding, lists, tables) to make it skimmable and visually appealing for the judges.
